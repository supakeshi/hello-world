Hello Everyone!

My name is Thomas and I'm just learning to walk (in respect to coding). I am pursuing a degree in computer science and am excited to begin making wonderous creations through the power of code! Or rather, convert the coffee, ramen, sushi, tea, and tacos into beautiful works of coding art.
